While being developed in the open, this tool is not open source. It's
free for use in creating non-commercial games, but is commercial when
used to develop commercial games.

I haven't figured out the commercial terms yet, but you should expect them
to be quite nominal. Email pytom@bishoujo.us if you really want to use
this experimental code to make a commercial game.
