This is development code, and isn't ready for public use yet.

License
-------

This is developed in the open, but is not open source. It is free for use
in creating non-commercial games, but is commercial when used to develop
commercial games - including but not limited to games that are charged for,
games that are supported by advertising, and games that are only available
to paid backers.

I haven't figured out the commercial terms yet, but you should expect them
to be quite nominal. Email pytom@bishoujo.us if you really want to use
this experimental code to make a commercial game.
